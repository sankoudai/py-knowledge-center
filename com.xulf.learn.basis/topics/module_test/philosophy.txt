1.  module is like object, and each process possesses only instance of it
    explain:
        - variable x within module has only one copy.
          So if you change value of x within one module,
          it is perceived by other modules imported later.

        - if a module is already imported, it won't be repeatedly imported on next import statement.
          (module top-level code won't be executed again.)
