P1:  Value and variable are two things.

P2: On type
    - Every Value has a type. (value type, if you like)
    - Variable does not have type. So it can point to value of any value type.
     (You can say variable is of reference type)

P3: On Object
    - All data(value) is object. You can say all data(value) types are subclass of Object.
    - Function is data (value) too. So it's object

P4: string  vs  bytes
    character is an abstraction, string is an immutable sequence of unicode characters: 'abc'
    bytes are an immutable sequence of numbers-between-0-and-255: b'abc\x12'
    Never mix them

P5: container are container of references
    list, tuple .. are container of reference. They can hold anything
